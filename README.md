## Metis_project4: podcast recommendation
### Description:
For people who listen to podcasts, many of us would agree that podcasts help us learn many new things. In addition, podcasts are just another form of entertainment that we could enjoy anywhere with our devices. However, with a vast selection of podcasts out there, it could be hard to decide on which podcast to listen to. Using natural language processing techniques, I explored in this project the topics hidden in podcast reviews. I then built a podcast recommendation system based on those podcast reviews.
